# MQTT-SERVER

First, install Telegram on PI

- for OS update - sudo app update
- To install Telegram, I install snap first by - sudo apt install snapd
- Then install telegram by - sudo snap install telegram-desktop
- Then I changed wifi to have a static IP of 192.168.1.130 by referring from https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/static-ip-raspberry-pi
- Note: I put 'request 192.168.1.130' instead of assinging with static IP address.
- The name server IP was 172.26.1.1

- Then I installed node red and mqtt on my raspberry pi by referring to https://www.makeuseof.com/install-mqtt-server-node-red-raspberry-pi-home-automation/
